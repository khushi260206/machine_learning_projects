Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from data without explicit programming. It involves using algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. Essentially, ML allows computers to learn from experience and get better at tasks over time
